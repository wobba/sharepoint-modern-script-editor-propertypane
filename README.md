## create-ts-library
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ryancat/create-ts-library.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ryancat/create-ts-library)

This is a repo that setup the basic structure for my (and your) next typescript library. Simply **fork it** and start coding!

### What it does
- Use typescript compiler to compile your library into:
  - `lib` directory for commonjs code to consume
  - `lib-esm` directory for es2015 code to consume
- Use webpack version 4 to bundle the code into:
  - `bundle` directory as an UMD module for others 
- Setup npm scripts for easy build
  - `npm run dev` to compile to above directories
  - `npm run dev:watch` to watch the file changes (by nodemon) and run the build script
  - `npm run build` to generate minimized code for publish
